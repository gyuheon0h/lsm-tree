File stream -> Mem_table -> Flushed to disk (SStables)

**SSTable Format**

- The SSTable (Sorted String Table) stores data in a sorted order on disk.
- Each entry in the SSTable is a key-value pair.
- The key is typically a unique identifier for the data.
- The value is the actual data associated with the key, which can be a tuple of numbers or any serializable data structure.
- The SSTable is immutable once written, making it efficient for read-heavy operations.


NAIVE APPROACH
**Example Entry Format in SSTable:**
key1: (value1_part1, value1_part2, value1_part3)
key2: (value2_part1, value2_part2, value2_part3)
...
keyN: (valueN_part1, valueN_part2, valueN_part3)

- Each key-value pair is stored on a new line.
- The key and value are separated by a colon and a space.
- The values are enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

BETTER WAY SHOULD COMPACT
- Don't write text, should write bytes
- Shouldnt index by key, we should have file byte offsets
- Each SSTable block should be 64kb (just to start off with)

Point: (key->value)
Offset table: Map (key -> offset into SSTable of values)
Stores values
